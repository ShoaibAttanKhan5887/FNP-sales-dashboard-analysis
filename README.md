4. **Pivot Tables:** Created dynamic pivot tables to aggregate revenue, order quantities, and delivery times based on multiple dimensions, such as month, category, and occasion.
5. **Data Visualization:** Utilized Excel charts for:
   - Bar charts (Revenue by Category and Occasion)
   - Line charts (Revenue by Month and Weekdays)
   - Horizontal Bar Chart (Top 10 Cities by Orders)
6. **Dashboard Design:** Ensured user-friendly and interactive visuals, including filters for periods and occasions.

## Projects Insights
- ***Revenue Fluctuations:*** Significant sales spikes in February and August suggest seasonal sales trends, possibly linked to Valentineâ€™s Day and Raksha Bandhan.
- ***High Revenue from Colors and Soft Toys:*** Indicates demand for vibrant and emotional gifting items.
- ***City Trends:*** Imphal and Dhanbad emerge as strong markets; focusing marketing efforts there could drive further growth.
- ***Delivery Time:*** Average delivery time is 5.53 days, which may need optimization for better customer satisfaction.
- ***Weekday Sales Trends:*** Sunday and Tuesday drive more sales, indicating potential for targeted promotions.

## Final Conclusions
The sales dashboard provides actionable insights that Ferns and Petals can use to improve its sales strategies:

1. Focus marketing campaigns during peak seasons like Valentine's Day and Raksha Bandhan.
2. Improve delivery logistics to reduce the average delivery time.
3. Capitalize on high-revenue product categories like Colors and Soft Toys by expanding inventory or running promotions.
4. Strengthen marketing and delivery networks in high-performing cities such as Imphal and Dhanbad.

This data-driven approach will enable Ferns and Petals (FnP) to optimize operations, enhance customer satisfaction, and increase revenue.
